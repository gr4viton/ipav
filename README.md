## Reason

During my doctoral studies I developed this tiny little thing with a possibility of it being used during teaching of image processing on the Brno university of technology.

Written a few "articles" about this project and a few of it's developed applications.

## Workings

Write down textual names of several image processing functions, and the `ipav` visualises the image undergoing the individual steps for you.

Also used for generating 3d model from silhouettes of an objects captured by multiple web cameras.


## Realisation

- python program (2.6?)
- kivy UI package
- openCV - image processing
- blender cli server running
  - 3D model shaping ->

- developed on Windows 7 desktop (rip)
